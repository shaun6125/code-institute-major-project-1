# PERSONAL PORTFOLIO WEBSITE
 
#### User-Centric Front-End Development Project

In this project, we were asked to create a 3-4 page website for the use of a personal portfolio/resume to reach potential hiring managers.

## UX DESIGN

For this project I have used the Framework known as "[Bootstrap 4.2.1](http://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.2/)" for the initial layout and added my own CSS for the look of the website and to style some elements.

This website is aimed at potential hiring managers and as a means of showcasing my own abilities and development to date.
It is easily navigated with an easily understandable navigation bar. All infomation is displayed clear and easy to see. All media such as "<img>" and "<iframe>" has been sized accordingly.


All Mock-Ups and planning I did for this project can be found here

## FEATURES

All pages on this site include the "Header" and "Footer". The Header consists of the navigation bar and logo. The Footer has links to my personal social media pages.

I chose "white", "gray" and "Black" for the main background colors as they are nuteral and allowed for the colour in he elements to really stand out, drawing the user to them. The colors used in this project were:

- "#fafafa" (**WHITE. Text Color**)
- "#0D182859 & #0d18287c " (**GRAY. Section background Color**)
- "#20a8df, #9B19FF, #FBED20, #0AFF71 " (**nav button Colors**)
- "rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2)" (**Hover Effect**)
- "#0D1828" (**Header and Footer Background color**)

I have imported the fonts from Google: "**Exo & Roboto**" (Roboto used for the title and Exo used for the main text across the whole site).
I chose "Exo & Roboto" as they are clean, simple and retain an element of professionalism. 

### [index.html] (https://shaun6125.github.io/code-institute-major-project-1/index.html)

This is the landing page, where potential employers would find out alittle bit about myself, and as most employers make snap decisions on resumes I wanted to highlight my skills here by encorporating a carousel portfolio to past projects.

Footer Links applied to all pages:

- [Facebook](ADD LINK HERE!!!)
- [Twitter](ADD LINK HERE!!!)
- [Youtube](ADD LINK HERE!!!)
- [Instagram](ADD LINK HERE!!!)
- [Linkedin](ADD LINK HERE!!!)
- [Pinterest](ADD LINK HERE!!!)

The Image [profile1.jpg] was taken and edited. With better software I would have vectorised the image and mapped the open/closing tags to the shape of my face. 

### [resume.html](https://shaun6125.github.io/code-institute-major-project-1/resume.html)

This page is dedicated to giving a breakdown of my work history, an up to date display of progress into the development of Full Stack Developer skills, of which will be updated during the progress of the course.

### [contact.html](https://shaun6125.github.io/code-institute-major-project-1/contact.html)

This page is where emloyers can contact me directly and submit any potential project specifications that they may wish for me to work on.

On this page, I have added a contact form with details on each row being required for submit.

### [download.html](INSERT LINK HERE!!!)

This page is where employers can download a pdf version of my full CV. I have set this link to open in a new window so that they are not taken away from the core website, ensuring time can be taken to explore further.

## TECHNOLOGIES

Here are links to each techonology I have used:

- [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5)
- [CSS3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets)
- [Bootstrap 4.2.1](http://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.2/)
- [Font Awesome 5](https://fontawesome.com)


## TESTING

I conducted tests on a wide selction of browsers/devices to ensure User's can successfully use the site and it's features.

Tests conducted:

- Checking the responsiveness
- Making sure each link worked porperly
- All images resize appropriately 
- Carousel/slider change between devices
- On the contact page I designed and created the form with validation in mind, To this end I checked that the contact form worked using
code institutes form validation tester "https://formdump.codeinstitute.net/".

Once all coding was done I ran the code through the [HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) and the [CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/). After running the test on each file I fixed any errors given and the files are now validated.


These tests included browsers/devices:

- Edge - laptop and desktop
- Mozilla - laptop and desktop
- Chrome - laptop and desktop
- Safari - Iphone
- Samsung internet browser - android
- Internet Explorer - laptop and desktop

## Issues/Bugs

I had several issues with the implementation of the carousel and its sizing when scaling across different platforms, due to this I decided that a transition beteen a carousel and a slider would be needed to enhance the user experience.
This seemed to correct my scalability issues.

The slider failed to operate as intended, despite testing and aknowledging its workability in replit as a single element. The resolution for this was to refer to bootstrap for a new build and link in some jquery scripts to enable operation. 

## DEPLOYMENT

Whenever I thought that a page was finished, I deployed it to "**GitHub Pages**".
